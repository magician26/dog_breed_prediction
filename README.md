Dog Breed Prediction Model
Welcome to the Dog Breed Prediction Model repository! üêæüîç

This project is a deep learning-based model that predicts the breed of a dog from an uploaded image using computer vision techniques. Whether you're a dog lover,
a breed enthusiast, or just curious about the capabilities of AI, this model is sure to pique your interest. 

How It Works
Upload an Image: Simply choose an image of your dog using the provided interface.
Prediction: Once the image is uploaded, the model uses its trained neural network to analyze the image and predict the breed of the dog.
Result: The predicted breed is displayed to the user, offering insights into the lineage of their furry friend.
Features
Accurate Predictions: Trained on a diverse dataset comprising various dog breeds, the model delivers accurate predictions.
User-Friendly Interface: The user interface is intuitive and easy to use, making the prediction process hassle-free.
Fast Processing: The model swiftly processes the uploaded image, providing instant results.
Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used for model development.
Deep Learning: Utilized for training the neural network model.
Keras with TensorFlow Backend: The framework used for building and training the neural network.
Streamlit: Used for creating the user-friendly web interface.
Usage
Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/your_username/dog-breed-prediction.git
Install Dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Application: streamlit run app.py
Upload an Image: Follow the instructions on the web interface to upload an image of a dog.
View Prediction: Once the image is uploaded, the predicted breed will be displayed on the interface.

Note:
You have to export the model from the in h5 format from the collab file attached in the repository to use the model.
